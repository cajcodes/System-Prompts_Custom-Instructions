# System Prompts
This repository contains a collection of system prompts (custom instructions) that I've found effective for various large language models (LLMs). These prompts can be used to fine-tune the behavior and output of LLMs like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude-3-Opus.

## Usage:
* OpenAI GPT-4: Use these prompts as custom instructions within the GPT-4 interface.
* Claude-3-Opus: Create a text file containing your desired prompt(s) and upload it along with your initial prompt to Claude-3-Opus.

## Source:
These prompts have been developed and refined over time. While some elements may have originated from online sources, the overall collection reflects my personal experimentation and successful configurations. Feel free to adapt and modify these prompts to suit your specific needs.

## Disclaimer:
The effectiveness of these prompts may vary depending on the specific LLM and your desired outcome.
