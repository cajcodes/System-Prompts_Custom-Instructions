# System Prompts
This repository contains a collection of system prompts (custom instructions) that I've found effective for various large language models (LLMs). These prompts can be used to fine-tune the behavior and output of LLMs like OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude-3-Opus, and Local LLMs.

## Usage:
* OpenAI GPT-4: Use these prompts as custom instructions within the GPT-4 interface.
* Claude-3-Opus: Create a text file containing your desired prompt(s) and upload it along with your initial prompt to Claude-3-Opus.
* Llama-3: So far Llama-3 is not responding well to my system prompts. I'm experimenting and will be continually updating.
* Command-R-Plus: Follows the system prompt pretty well. I think it needs a highly specific use case to be effective. 

## Source:
These prompts have been developed and refined over time. While some elements may have originated from online sources, the overall collection reflects my personal experimentation and successful configurations. Feel free to adapt and modify these prompts to suit your specific needs.

## Disclaimer:
* The effectiveness of these prompts may vary depending on the specific LLM and your desired outcome.
* I'm also constantly updating prompts for new models and new projects.
